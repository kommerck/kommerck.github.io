Cancers are very hard to treat. In fact, cancer caused about 16% of worldwide deaths since 1980, [according to a recent study](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(16)31012-1). Cancer cells are our own body cells which went rogue, dividing at an extreme rate and hijacking nearby tissues -- and even our own immune system has difficulties to differentiate them from the normal cells, let alone cancer treatment methods.

Unsurprisingly, chemotherapy, one of the first approaches to treat cancer, available since back in the 1960ies, is, quite a sledgehammer-to-crack-a-nut approach. Chemotherapy drugs prevent cells from dividing, but usually affect both healthy and cancer cells at the same time. The treatment usually works out because cancer cells divide much more rapidly than the non-cancer cells: normal tissues rely on cell division much less than the cancer cells, whose only purpose is to keep dividing uncontrollably. Yet, the suffering of the healthy tissues leads to severe side effects in chemotherapy patients, such as nausea, hair loss, weakness, weakening of the immune system. Therefore, since the advent of chemotherapy there is an ongoing research effort to increase the selectivity of chemotherapy drugs -- that is, to distinguish better between the cancer and the healthy cells.

One approach to deal with this issue is the [photodynamic therapy (PDT)](https://doi.org/10.1038/nrc1071). A PDT agent, called a _photosensitiser_, is not harmful or even active on its own, but when activated with light, it can convert the oxygen in the surrounding cell to [singlet oxygen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singlet_oxygen) and other reactive species, which damages and destroys the cells. One can selectively target tumours with light -- by just illuminating the cancer if it is close enough to the skin, or by using various [fibre optic devices](https://doi.org//10.1016/j.pdpdt.2010.06.001).

While often PDT is more promising than chemotherapy for some types of cancers, it is also not without side effects. Many tumours show decreased levels of oxygen due to their rapid growth, and lower level of oxygen means lower efficiency of the therapy. Also photosensitisers, as their name says, render the patients very sensitive to light: patients must avoid the exposure of skin to direct sunlight for a prolonger period of time.

As a remedy to the above disadvantages, drugs with alternate mechanisms of action are sought for. Platinum-based chemotherapy drugs (most notably, [cisplatin](https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancer-in-general/treatment/cancer-drugs/drugs/cisplatin) and [oxaliplatin](https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancer-in-general/treatment/cancer-drugs/drugs/oxaliplatin-eloxatin)) are very effective against various kinds of tumours, but show severe side effects, ranging from feeling tired or sick to more severe long-term effects, such as weakening of immune system, kidney damage or permanent loss of fertility. However, recent research [suggests](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ccr.2018.08.009) a new class of platinum-based drugs, which are inactive and non-toxic unless activated with light. Such drugs would allow for combining the advantages of light-based therapy (i. e. selectivity and less side effects) without having the disadvantages of the photosensitisers (i. e. prolonged light sensitivity).

This project investigates the mechanisms of light activation of the new platinum-based drugs with cutting-edge quantum chemistry methods. Quantum chemistry allows insights into very early steps of the processes in molecules that are triggered by light. Insights obtained with quantum chemical methods would greatly aid the design of new platinum-based or other drugs for photodynamic therapy, as well as improvement of the selectivity and efficiency of the existing drugs.
