I am a researcher at the [University of Vienna](https://www.univie.ac.at) at the [Institute of Theoretical Chemistry](https://itc.univie.ac.at) in the group of [Prof. Leticia Gonz√°lez](https://theochem.univie.ac.at). In my research I develop quantum chemical methods and employ them to accurately predict excited states of transition metal complexes. This allows us to design better artificial photosynthesis systems or light-activated anticancer drugs.

I have a strong background in scientific computing and am a co-author of two (not very well-known) quantum chemistry codes [OpenMolcas](https://gitlab.com/Molcas/OpenMolcas) and [QCMaquis](https://github.com/qcscine/qcmaquis). I'm also interested in machine learning.
